# Calculator-project
I have created this project using Html , Css and javascript . This is a UI based Calculator which has keypad type system . You can enter a number 
by simply clicking on that key using Mouse. for next releasse i am also going to add keyboard events so that you can enter no in it using your keyboard.

I have also added the clicking effect in it using javascript so that it can closely resemble that you are clicking actual buttons.

## Added small screen responsiveness

I have also added responsiveness for small screens so that it can be compatible when a user views it on a mobile screen.
